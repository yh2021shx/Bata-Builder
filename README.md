# Data-Builder

## About

This is an application for generating data.  You just need to give your `std.exe` program and your `data.exe` program, and it will automatically generate the data for you.

## Usage

You need to copy the data `builder.exe` file from this folder to the parent directory of your `std.exe` program. Note: `std.exe`, `data.exe`, and `data builder.exe` must be in the same directory.
Then, run the `exe` file. You can give the name of the `data`, the name of the `std`, and the number of groups you need to generate, in order from top to bottom. Then wait for it to print "Completed!" .
